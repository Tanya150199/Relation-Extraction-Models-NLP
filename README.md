# Relation-Extraction-Models-NLP
This project explores relation extraction in NLP using SemEval-2010 data. The "SVM+RF-SVM" model combines SVC and RandomForest in a Stacking Classifier. The "BiLSTM-CNN-Multi-Head Attention" model uses deep learning with CNNs, Bi-LSTM, and attention mechanisms. Evaluations show promising accuracy and F1 Scores.
